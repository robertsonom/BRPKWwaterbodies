##### Project Name

Notable Bodies of Water Between Blowing Rock and Linville, NC along the Blue Ridge Parkway.

Lab 3

##### Introduction

This map shows major lake/pond locations between Blowing Rock and Linville, NC. Its purpose is so that people can use the map to plan or designate hikes if they are ever in the area or perhaps moving between the two cities. The map is simple, the route is marked with a dashed line and the locations are marked with markers. 

##### Functions

The map can be manually moved around using the cursor, and zoomed in using the mouse wheel as with most web maps. The markers at the major bodies of water have their names appear when your mouse hovers over the markers. Internally, there is also a field associated with these bodies of water that identifies them as either a "lake" or "pond". This function is not included in the final map because the water bodies' title already mentions whether it is a lake or pond in it. Everything else is just text. 

Some special things about said text: 

* There is a link to the basemap in the attribution text. 
* There is a link located near the bottom of the second paragraph, which leads to a website that has images of the trail that is being talked about. 
    * Hovering over this link shows alt text which briefly explains where the link leads.

##### Libraries
